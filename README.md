# GroupIz ðŸ“š
This is the frontend of Groupiz, a project which was used to help with group quizzes during Covid-19 and was my first project using ejs.

This project uses EJS to automatically grab new questions and answers from the API and update them in the UI.

The backend can be found here: https://github.com/ParkerSm1th/GroupizAPI

You can see a live version of this project here: https://grpiz.io
